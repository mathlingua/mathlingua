Instead\\nit is to provide a robust and easy to use tool for describing\\nmathematics with more structure than what is found in traditional\\nbooks and encyclopedias.\\n\\n## An Example\\n\\nConsider (one part of) the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\\nexpress in MathLingua:\\n::\\n\\n\\nTheorem: \\\"Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\\\"\\ngiven: f(x), F(x), I, a, b\\nwhere:\\n. 'a, b is \\\\real'\\n. 'f(x) is \\\\continuous.function:on{I}'\\n. 'F(x) is \\\\indefinite.integral:of{f(x)}:on{I}'\\nsuchThat:\\n. 'a < b'\\n. 'I := \\\\open.interval{a, b}'\\nthen:\\n. '\\\\definite.integral[x]_{a}^{b}:of{f(x)} = F(b) - F(a)'\\n\\n\\n::\\nThe MathLingua code for the theorem is given below, and the\\nMathLingua command line tool `mlg` automatically creates the\\nabove rendering of the theorem.\\n```math\\nTheorem: \\\"Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\\\"\\ngiven: f(x), F(x), I, a, b\\nwhere:\\n. 'a, b is \\\\real'\\n. 'f(x) is \\\\continuous.function:on{I}'\\n. 'F(x) is \\\\indefinite.integral:of{f(x)}:on{I}'\\nsuchThat:\\n. 'a < b'\\n. 'I := \\\\open.interval{a, b}'\\nthen:\\n. '\\\\definite.integral[x]_{a}^{b}:of{f(x)} = F(b) - F(a)'\\n```\\n\\nNote that MathLingua provides a clear syntax that is as\\nverbose as spoken mathematics but renders to the symbols\\nused in written mathematics.\\n\\nNext, the MathLingua language uses a clean indented style with\\na consistent format for describing definitions, theorems, and\\nother items to make recording and reading such information easy.\\n\\nFurther, the MathLingua language allows authors to define not\\njust the meaning of definitions, but how the concepts they\\ndefined are written in the literature or spoken out loud.\\n\\nLast, without any configuration needed, the MathLingua\\ntooling generates beautiful dynamic web pages to explore\\nthe math catalog created.  This web page itself, is made\\nentirely with MathLingua!\\n\\n## The Power of MathLingua\\n\\nTo see the power of the web pages created, click on the definite\\nintegral symbol inside the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\\ndefinition above.\\n\\nA popup will appear that shows that this\\nrepresents `\\\\definite.integral:of` and if you click on that\\ntext, the definition of the definite integral is displayed.\\n\\nFurther, you can keep clicking on text in the definition\\nof the definite integral to dive deeper into understanding\\nthe definition.\\n\\nAll an author needs to do is describe the Fundamental\\nTheorem of Calclus and the definite integral in MathLingua.\\nThe MathLingua tooling then handles everything else to make\\na beautiful and powerful web page to explore that knowledge.\\n\\n## More Examples\\n\\nThe *A Detailed Example* section of this site contains a\\nmore detailed example of a collection of MathLingua documents.\\n\\nIn addition, the [Math Codex](https://www.mathcodex.org) is\\nan ongoing effort to build a library of mathematical knowledge\\nwritten in MathLingua.  The source code can be found at the\\n[codex](https://github.com/DominicKramer/codex) GitHub repo.\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\nMathLingua is still in beta.  It and this document are still\\nunder development.\\n\\nTo discuss MathLingua you can join the\\n[MathLingua Discord](https://discord.gg/FsG7HvdmZ6)\\nor send an email to Dominic Kramer, the\\ncreator of MathLingua, at\\n[DominicKramer@gmail.com](mailto:DominicKramer@gmail.com).\\n\\nAll questions, comments, and feedback are greatly\\nappreciated.\\n\\n## What$\\\\'$s Next\\n\\nUse the menu icon in the top left corner of the page to\\nnavigate this document and discover more about\\nMathLingua or use the right arrow icon below to go to\\nthe next page.\\n::\\n","entities":[{"id":"A497CFBA61F81DB319571FBCB53BC5E4","relativePath":"content/10_Introduction.math","type":"TopLevelBlockComment","signature":null,"called":[],"rawHtml":"<span class='mathlingua'><span class='mathlingua-block-comment'> <h1>The MathLingua Language</h1><p><em>MathLingua is a language to create precise,\nautomatically analyzed, beautifully rendered, collections\nof mathematical knowledge.</em></p><style>\n.icon {\ntransform: scale(0.15);\nmargin-top: -20em;\nmargin-bottom: -20em;\nmargin-left: -2.5em;\nmargin-right: 0;\npadding: 0;\n}\n</style>\n<div class=\"icon\">\n<img src=\"./content/mathlingua-icon.png\" />\n</div>\n<h2>The Problem</h2><p>Today there is so much mathematical knowledge, (definitions,\ntheorems, axioms, and conjectures) that it is hard to keep track\nof what is known and what is unknown.</p><p>To record mathematical knowledge today one typically uses either:</p><ul><li>LaTeX that describes what a math statement looks like and\nis convenient to write, but:</li></ul><ol><li>doesn<code>\\'</code>t describe what a math statement means</li><li>doesn<code>\\'</code>t have tools to verify that definitions and\ntheorems are used correctly and don<code>\\'</code>t reference\nundefined symbols or definitions</li></ol><ul><li>proof assistant languages that describe what a math\nstatement means and have verification capabilities but:</li></ul><ol><li>don<code>\\'</code>t describe what a math statement looks like</li><li>have a very steep learning curve</li><li>require all math statements to be expressed extremely\nformally often very differently from how they are\ntypically expressed in math literature</li></ol><p>What we need is a language to easily describe the meaning\nand appearance of mathematical concepts with the same level of\nformality of traditional math literature, all with the ability\nto be analyzed automatically.</p><p>MathLingua is that language.</p><h2>Introducing MathLingua</h2><p>MathLingua is a unique language for creating collections of\nmathematical knowledge that are expressed precisely, rendered\nbeautifully, and whose connections and usages are analyzed\nautomatically.</p><p>This allows authors to focus on describing what definitions,\ntheorems, axioms, and conjectures mean without having to manually\ncheck definitions are used correctly, every term used\nis defined, and statements are precise.</p><p>MathLingua is not a typesetting language like LaTeX, and it is\nnot a proof assistant (or automated theorem prover) like Lean.\nInstead, it is in-between.</p><p>It provides checking of results (although doesn<code>\\'</code>t provide all\nof the checks of proof assistants) while providing an easy to use\nlanguage for precisely describing the structure of results with\nthe level of formality comparable to traditional math literature.</p><p>The goal of MathLingua isn<code>\\'</code>t automated theorem proving.

Here we get\ninto more details about some of the specifics related to\nrendering LaTeX code and the analyzes the MathLingua\ntooling provides.</p><h2>MathLingua LaTeX Rendering</h2><p>As covered in more detail in the\n<a href=\"#/content/30_A_Tour_of_MathLingua.math\">A Tour of MathLingua</a>\nsection, LaTeX code can be used to express what mathematical\nstatements look like as well as provide additional background\ntext.</p><p>Specifically, any LaTeX code can be used that is supported\nby <a href=\"https://katex.org/docs/supported.html\">KaTeX</a>, which\nMathLingua uses for rendering.</p><h2>MathLingua Analysis Details</h2><p>When the MathLingua tooling analyzes MathLingua code it\nspecifically identifies the following:</p><ul><li>symbols and definitions referenced that have not been defined</li><li>symbols and defintions that have been defined more than once</li><li><code>is</code> descriptions that are invalid as described below</li><li><code>is</code> descriptions that are circular as described below</li><li>using definitions with the wrong number of input parameters</li><li>concrete concepts used in an abstract setting</li><li>abstract concepts used in a concrete setting</li><li>text that does not conform to the MathLingua grammar</li></ul><h3>Invalid <code>is</code> Descriptions</h3><p>Consider the following definitions that are brief for\nillustrative purposes:</p> \n    <pre><code>[\\set]\nDefines: X\nmeans: &quot;A collection of objects&quot;\nwritten: &quot;\\textrm{Set}&quot;\n</code></pre> \n     \n    <pre><code>[\\function:on{A}:to{B}]\nDefines: f(x)\nwhen: A, B is \\textrm{Set}\nmeans:\n. forAll: t\nsuchThat: t in A\nthen: f(t) in B\nwritten: &quot;\\textrm{Function from } A? \\textrm{ to } B?&quot;\n</code></pre> \n     \n    <pre><code>[\\bounded.function:on{A}:to{B}]\nDefines: f(x)\nwhen: &quot;...&quot;\nmeans:\n. f is f? : A \\rightarrow B\n. &quot;...&quot;\nwritten: &quot;...&quot;\n</code></pre> \n     \n    <pre><code>[\\continuous.function:on{A}:to{B}]\nDefines: f(x)\nwhen: &quot;...&quot;\nmeans:\n. f is f? : A \\rightarrow B\n. &quot;...&quot;\nwritten: &quot;...&quot;\n</code></pre> \n    <p>In the definitions above, <code>\\set</code> and <code>\\function:on{A}:to{B}</code>\nare called <em>terminal definitions</em> because they do not contain\nany <code>is</code>, <code>in</code>, or <code>:=</code> expressions in their <code>means:</code>\nsections.</p><p>A MathLingua statement is said to have <em>invalid <code>is</code>\ndescriptions</em> if the <code>is</code> descriptions specify that some\nsymbol is defined to have more than one terminal definition.</p><p>As an example, suppose <code>f(x)</code> is specified such that</p><pre><code>f(x) is \\bounded.function:on{A}:to{B}\n</code></pre><p>this means the terminal definition <code>\\function:on{A}:to{B}</code>\napplies to <code>f(x)</code> because <code>\\bounded.function:on{A}:to{B}</code>\nhas an <code>is</code> expression in its <code>means:</code> sections that specifies\nthat the thing being defined is a <code>\\function:on{A}:to{B}</code>.</p><p>Similarly, saying that</p><pre><code>f(x) is \\continuous.function:on{A}:to{B}\n</code></pre><p>means that <code>f(x)</code> has <code>function:on{A}:to{B}</code> as a\nterminal definition.</p><p>Thus, the definition</p> \n    <pre><code>[\\some.function:on{A}:to{B}]\nDefines: f(x)\nwhen: &quot;...&quot;\nmeans:\n. f(x) is \\bounded.function:on{A}:to{B}\n. f(x) is \\continuous.function:on{A}:to{B}\nwritten: &quot;...&quot;\n</code></pre> \n    <p>does not have any invalid <code>is</code> descriptions because\nboth <code>is</code> descriptions in the <code>means:</code> section specify\nthat <code>f(x)</code> has a single terminal definition\n<code>\\function:on{A}:to{B}</code>.</p><p>However, the following definition has invalid <code>is</code>\ndescriptions:</p> \n    <pre><code>[\\another.function:on{A}:to{B}]\nDefines: f(x)\nwhen: &quot;...&quot;\nmeans:\n. f(x) is \\bounded.function:on{A}:to{B}\n. f(x) is \\continuous.function:on{A}:to{B}\n. f(x) is \\textrm{Set}\nwritten: &quot;...&quot;\n</code></pre> \n    <p>This is because the <code>is</code> descriptions</p><pre><code>f(x) is \\bounded.function:on{A}:to{B}\n</code></pre><p>and</p><pre><code>f(x) is \\continuous.function:on{A}:to{B}\n</code></pre><p>specify that <code>f(x)</code> has the terminal definition\n<code>\\function:on{A}:to{B}</code> juast as in the\n<code>\\some.function:on{A}:to{B}</code> example above.</p><p>However, the <code>is</code> description</p><pre><code>f(x) is

We want to focus on group\\ntheory and so informally thinking about a set as a\\ncollection of things is enough.  As such, we define a\\nset as follows:\\n\\n```math\\n[\\\\set]\\nDefines: S := {s}\\nsatisfying: \\\"A collection of things\\\"\\nwritten: \\\"\\\\textrm{Set}\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Set\\\"\\n```\\n\\nand is rendered as\\n::\\n\\n[\\\\set]\\nDefines: S := {s}\\nsatisfying:\\n. \\\"$s$ is well defined\\\"\\n. \\\"A well defined collection of things\\\"\\nwritten: \\\"\\\\textrm{Set}\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Set\\\"\\n\\n::\\nWe use a `Defines:` to specify that we are defining\\nsomething.  `\\\\set` is used to represent the thing $X$\\nbeing defined.\\n\\nNext we say that `X := {x}` to specify $X$ is a\\nhomogenous collection-like object with $x$ being\\na representative from that collection.\\n\\nAs a comparison, besides the form `X := {x}`,\\nthe form `f(x)` is used for function like objects,\\n`{x_{i}}_{i}` is used for sequence-like objects, and\\n`(X, Y, *)` for tuples.\\n\\nFurther, we use text in double quotes in the `satisfying:`\\nsection because we are informally describing what a set\\nis.  Formal statements, on the other hand, are enclosed\\nin single quotes as we`\\\\'`ll see later.\\n\\nNext with the notion of a *set* described, we want to\\ndescribe what a *binary operation* on a set is.  But\\nfirst, we`\\\\'`ll describe what a *function* is, since a\\nbinary operation is a type of function.\\n\\n```math\\n[\\\\function:on{A}:to{B}]\\nDefines: f(x)\\nwhen: 'A, B is \\\\set'\\nsatisfying:\\n. 'x in A'\\n. 'f(x) in B'\\n. forAll: a\\n  suchThat: 'a in A'\\n  then:\\n  . existsUnique: b\\n    where: 'b in B'\\n    suchThat:\\n    . 'f(a) = b'\\nwritten: \\\"f? : A? \\\\rightarrow B?\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Function on $A?$ to $B?$\\\"\\n```\\n\\nwhich is rendered as:\\n::\\n\\n[\\\\function:on{A}:to{B}]\\nDefines: f(x)\\nwhen: 'A, B is \\\\set'\\nsatisfying:\\n. 'x in A'\\n. 'f(x) in B'\\n. forAll: a\\n  suchThat: 'a in A'\\n  then:\\n  . existsUnique: b\\n    where: 'b in B'\\n    suchThat:\\n    . 'f(a) = b'\\nwritten: \\\"f? : A? \\\\rightarrow B?\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Function on $A?$ to $B?$\\\"\\nMetadata:\\n. note: \\\"The key characteristic of a function is\\n  that every input is mapped to a *unique* output.\\\"\\n\\n::\\n\\n## Diving Deeper\\n\\nThere is a lot of aspects of the MathLingua language being\\nused in the definition above that we will analyze next.\\n\\nFirst, we describe that a function is a mapping-like object\\n`f(x)` that maps elements of the set `A` to unique elements\\nof the set `B` and we specify that the command\\n`\\\\function:on{A}:to{B}` describes a function.\\n\\nNotice that the command `\\\\function:on{A}:to{B}`\\nreads similar to how one describes a function when speaking.\\n\\nCommands for definitions start with a `\\\\` and\\nthe `:on{A}:to{B}` part of the command allows one to\\nspecify named arguments.\\n\\n> **Note:** We could have alternately specified that the command\\n`\\\\function{A, B}` describes a function, but using named\\narguments makes the command easier to remember and read.\\n\\nAdditionally, right now we are just talking about a function,\\nbut, in the future, if we wanted to define a real-valued\\nfunction, for example, we could state that the command\\n`\\\\real.function:on{A}:to{B}` specifies a real-valued function.\\n\\nIt is common to use the `\\\\adjective.noun:namedArguments`\\npattern for command names since it is similar to how\\nmathematical objects are typically described when speaking.\\n\\nHowever this is not a hard requirement, and you can use\\nwhatever name format that makes the most sense for you.\\n\\nNext, the symbol `is` is a keyword in MathLingua, it specifies\\nhow the symbol on the left of the `is` is defined.  In\\nthis case, `A, B is \\\\set` means `A` is a `\\\\set` and\\n`B` is a also a `\\\\set`.\\n\\nFurther, the symbol `in` is also keyword in MathLingua.\\nThe line `x in A` means that `x` is \\\"in\\\" `A`, and the\\nfact that `A` is a `\\\\set`, and the definition of a set\\nis an object `S := {s}` where `s is well defined` means\\nthat `x is well defined`.\\n\\nFurthermore, notice the `written:` and `called:` sections in\\nthe definition of a function.\\n\\nThe text in the written section is interpreted as being\\nin LaTeX math mode, and describes what symbols are written\\non paper to specify that something is a function.  Here\\nwe use the notation $f : A \\\\rightarrow B$.\\n\\nThe `called:` section, on the other hand, has text that\\nis written using CommonMark Markdown and describes what is\\nspoken when reading $f : A \\\\rightarrow B$, which, in this\\ncase, is \\\"$f$ is a continuous function on $A$ to $B$\\\".\\n\\nAlso notice that we included the optional\\n`Metadata:overview:` section that has text that is written\\nusing Markdown, and describes any additional information\\nyou would like to add.  In this case, we call out that a\\nfunction maps an input to a *unique* output.\\n\\nLast, an indent based syntax is used to describe the structure\\nof the definition with expressions (such as `A, B is \\\\set`)\\nincluded in single quotes.\\n\\nNow we can describe what a cartesian product of two sets\\nis that we`\\\\'`ll need for defining a binary operation.  We\\ndo that using the MathLingua text:\\n\\n```math\\n[A \\\\set.product/ B]\\nDefines: X := {x, y}\\nwhen: 'A, B is \\\\set'\\nmeans: 'X is \\\\set'\\nexpressing:\\n. 'x in A'\\n. 'y in B'\\nwritten: \\\"A? \\\\times B?\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Cartesian Product of $A?$ and $B?$\\\"\\n```\\nthat is rendered as\\n::\\n\\n[A \\\\set.product/ B]\\nDefines: X := {x, y}\\nwhen: 'A, B is \\\\set'\\nmeans: 'X is \\\\set'\\nexpressing:\\n. 'x in A'\\n. 'y in B'\\nwritten: \\\"A+? \\\\times B+?\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Cartesian Product of $A?$ and $B?$\\\"\\n\\n::\\nSimilar to the definition of a set, the Cartesian product\\nbetween two sets, $A$ and $B$, is a collection of pairs\\n$X : = {x,y}$ where the first element is from $A$ and the second\\nis from $B$.\\n\\nHere we use the notation `\\\\xxx/` that is used to define an\\ninfix command.  We could have also used the prefix command\\nformat like above, for example `\\\\set.product:of{A}:and{B}`, but\\nin this case, infix notation is more clear.\\n\\nAlso, notice that in the written section we use the syntax `A+?`\\nwhen referring to an input, in this case `A`, while in the\\ndefinition of a function, we used `A?`.\\n\\nThe `?`, `+?`, or `-?` instructs MathLingua how to replace\\nvariables when rendering the definition.  Thus\\n`X \\\\set.product/ Y` will be rendered as $X \\\\times Y$.\\n\\nThe use of `+?`, though specifies that parentheses should be\\nincluded for complex expressions.  Thus,\\n```\\n   {X \\\\set.product/ X} \\\\set.product/ Y\\n```\\nand\\n```\\n   (X \\\\set.product/ X) \\\\set.product/ Y\\n```\\nare both rendered as $(X \\\\times X) \\\\times Y$.\\n\\n> **Note:** `{}` and `()` are both used to group together\\n  expressions, but `{}` is not visible when rendered.\\n\\nIf a `?` was used instead, the above would have been rendered as\\n$X \\\\times X \\\\times Y$.\\n\\nLast, if a `-?` was used instead, then any parens around an\\nexpression will be removed.\\n\\nFurther, notice that the `Defines:` form above has an\\n`expressing:` section while the definition\\n`\\\\function:on{A}:to{B}` above has a `satisfying:` section.\\n\\nA `Defines:` with a `satisfying:` section defines an abstract\\nconcept while one with an `expressing:` defines a\\nsingle concrete object.\\n\\nConcrete objects can be used in expressions while\\nabstract concepts can be used on the right hand side of\\nan `is` statement.\\n\\nThat is, it is valid to say\\n```\\n(X \\\\set.product/ X) + A\\n```\\nor\\n```\\nX is \\\\function:on{A}:to{B}\\n```\\nbut it is invalid to say\\n```\\n\\\\function:on{A}:to{B} + X\\n```\\nor\\n```\\nA is X \\\\set.product/ X\\n```\\n\\nNow we define what a binary operation on a set is:\\n\\n```math\\n[\\\\binary.operation:on{A}]\\nDefines: *(a, b)\\nwhen: 'A is \\\\set'\\nmeans: '* is \\\\function:on{A \\\\set.product/ A}:to{A}'\\nwritten: \\\"\\\\textrm{binary operation on } A?\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Binary Operation on $A?$\\\"\\n```\\nthat is rendered as:\\n::\\n\\n\\n[\\\\binary.operation:on{A}]\\nDefines: *(a, b)\\nwhen: 'A is \\\\set'\\nmeans: '* is \\\\function:on{A \\\\set.product/ A}:to{A}'\\nwritten: \\\"\\\\textrm{binary operation on } A?\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Binary Operation on $A?$\\\"\\n\\n::\\nNote that in the structural language `*` is treated as an\\nidentifier just like `f`.  However, inside statements, in\\nsingle quotes, symbols like `*`, `/`, `**`, etc. are treated\\nas operators.\\n\\n## The Dynamics of MathLingua\\n\\nAn exciting aspect of MathLingua is that it creates a dynamic\\ndocument.  To see this, click on the\\n$* : A \\\\times A \\\\rightarrow A$ in the definition above.  From\\nthere you will see a dropdown menu listing `\\\\function:on:to`\\nand `\\\\set.product/`.\\n\\nIf you click on the menu items, the corresponding MathLingua\\nentry will be shown under the definition of a **Binary\\nOperation on $A$**.  You can further click on more text in the\\nitems that appear to drill down farther into the definitions.\\nThis makes it very easy to explore MathLingua concepts.\\n\\n## Recording Resources\\n\\nNow we have the machinery needed to define a group, but before\\nwe do that, we want to record a resource where we found the\\ndefintion of a group.\\n\\nIn particular, we found the definition of a group on page 7\\nof the book \\\"Group Theory\\\" by J.S. Milne.  To record that\\nresource, use a `Resource:` construct:\\n\\n```math\\n[@group.theory.js.milne]\\nResource:\\n. type: \\\"Course Notes\\\"\\n. name: \\\"Group Theory\\\"\\n. author: \\\"J.S. Milne\\\"\\n. homepage: \\\"https://www.jmilne.org\\\"\\n. url: \\\"https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/GT.pdf\\\"\\n. offset: \\\"0\\\"\\n```\\n\\nthat is rendered as:\\n\\n::\\n\\n[@GroupTheoryJsMilne]\\nResource:\\n. type: \\\"Course Notes\\\"\\n. name: \\\"Group Theory\\\"\\n. author: \\\"J.S.

Further, resource names can only contain\\nletters and digits and periods (`.`).\\n\\n## The Main Definition\\n\\nNow we can define a group:\\n\\n```math\\n[\\\\group]\\nDefines: G := (X, *, e)\\nmeans:\\n. 'X is \\\\set'\\nsatisfying:\\n. '* is \\\\binary.operation:on{X}'\\n. 'e in X'\\n. forAll: x\\n  where: 'x in X'\\n  then:\\n  . 'x * e = x'\\n  .

'x * y = e'\\nwritten: \\\"\\\\textrm{group}\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Group\\\"\\nProviding:\\n. membership:\\n  through: 'X'\\nMetadata:\\n. resources:\\n  . source: \\\"@GroupTheoryJsMilne\\\"\\n    page: \\\"7\\\"\\n```\\nthat is rendered as\\n::\\n\\n[\\\\group]\\nDefines: G := (X, *, e)\\nmeans:\\n.

'y in X'\\n    . 'x * y = e'\\nwritten: \\\"\\\\textrm{group}\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Group\\\"\\nProviding:\\n. membership:\\n  through: 'X'\\nMetadata:\\n. resources:\\n  . source: \\\"@GroupTheoryJsMilne\\\"\\n    page: \\\"7\\\"\\n\\n::\\nNotice we included a `Metadata:resources:` section that included\\nthe source `@GroupTheoryJsMilne` on page 7.\\n\\nThere is a new section we used in this definition that wasn`\\\\'`t\\nused previously, the `providing:` section.  This is used to describe\\nhow to interpret the object being defined, in this case a group.\\n\\nThe construct:\\n\\n```\\nas: '\\\\set'\\nvia: 'X'\\n```\\n\\ninstructs one to interperet the group that is the object\\n`G := (X, *, e)` as a `\\\\set` through its member `X`, which is a\\nset.\\n\\nThus, if `A ++ B` was defined to be an operator between two `\\\\set`s\\n`A` and `B`, then if `G := (X, *, e)` and `H := (Y, +, u)` where\\ntwo `\\\\groups`, then `G ++ H` would be evaluated as `X ++ Y` since\\n`G` can be viewed as the set `X` and `H` as the set `Y`.\\n\\nThat is, although `G` is tuple, the `as:via:` section allows us\\nto explicitly state that we may view it as a set, as is commonly\\ndone in mathematics literature.\\n\\nThe `membership:through:` section, on the other hand allows us\\nto specify what it means for one to say `x in G` where\\n`G := (X, *, e)` is a `\\\\group`, and\\n\\n```\\nmembership:\\nthrough: 'X'\\n```\\n\\nmeans to interpret `x in G` as saying `x in X`, again as is\\ntypically done in mathematics literature.\\n\\nThe two constructs, `as:via:` and `membership:group:` look the\\nsame but they are not.  In particular, `as:via:` allows one to\\nspecify how to view one mathematical object as another.  This\\ncould be, for example, how to view a group as a set or an integer\\nas a rational number.  It doesn`\\\\'`t need to involve sets.\\n\\nThe `membership:through:` construct, on the other hand, describes\\nhow to interpret `x in G` for some `G`.  If `G := (X, *, e)` is a\\n`\\\\group`, then `x in G` means `x in X`.\\n\\nNow that we have the definition of a group, we can describe a\\ntheorem that will refer to the inverse of an element in a\\ngroup.\\n\\nBefore doing so we`\\\\'`ll define what the inverse of an element is:\\n\\n```math\\n[\\\\group{G}.inverse:of{x}]\\nDefines: y\\ngiven: X, *, e\\nwhen:\\n. 'G := (X, *, e) is \\\\group'\\n. 'x in X'\\nmeans: 'y in G'\\nexpressing:\\n. 'x * y = e'\\n. 'y * x = e'\\nwritten: \\\"x+?^{-1}\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Inverse of $x?$\\\"\\n```\\nthat is rendered as:\\n::\\n\\n\\n[\\\\group{G}.inverse:of{x}]\\nDefines: y\\ngiven: X, *, e\\nwhen:\\n. 'G := (X, *, e) is \\\\group'\\n. 'x in X'\\nmeans: 'y in G'\\nexpressing:\\n. 'x * y = e'\\n. 'y * x = e'\\nwritten: \\\"{x+?}^{-1}\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"Inverse of $x?$\\\"\\n\\n::\\n## Adding a Theorem\\n\\nNow we can record our theorem.  It is a straightforward theorem\\nmeant to demonstrate how a theorem, and optionally its proof, are\\nrecorded.\\n\\nIt shows how to find the inverse of the product of two elements\\nin a group.\\n\\nThe following is the code for the theorem:\\n```math\\nTheorem:\\ngiven: G := (X, *, e), x, y\\nwhere:\\n. 'G is \\\\group'\\n. 'x, y in G'\\nthen:\\n. '\\\\inv((x * y)) = \\\\inv(y) * \\\\inv(x)'\\nusing:\\n.

next.</p><p>First, we describe that a function is a mapping-like object\n<code>f(x)</code> that maps elements of the set <code>A</code> to unique elements\nof the set <code>B</code> and we specify that the command\n<code>\\function:on{A}:to{B}</code> describes a function.</p><p>Notice that the command <code>\\function:on{A}:to{B}</code>\nreads similar to how one describes a function when speaking.</p><p>Commands for definitions start with a <code></code> and\nthe <code>:on{A}:to{B}</code> part of the command allows one to\nspecify named arguments.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> We could have alternately specified that the command\n<code>\\function{A, B}</code> describes a function, but using named\narguments makes the command easier to remember and read.</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, right now we are just talking about a function,\nbut, in the future, if we wanted to define a real-valued\nfunction, for example, we could state that the command\n<code>\\real.function:on{A}:to{B}</code> specifies a real-valued function.</p><p>It is common to use the <code>\\adjective.noun:namedArguments</code>\npattern for command names since it is similar to how\nmathematical objects are typically described when speaking.</p><p>However this is not a hard requirement, and you can use\nwhatever name format that makes the most sense for you.</p><p>Next, the symbol <code>is</code> is a keyword in MathLingua, it specifies\nhow the symbol on the left of the <code>is</code> is defined.  In\nthis case, <code>A, B is \\set</code> means <code>A</code> is a <code>\\set</code> and\n<code>B</code> is a also a <code>\\set</code>.</p><p>Further, the symbol <code>in</code> is also keyword in MathLingua.\nThe line <code>x in A</code> means that <code>x</code> is &quot;in&quot; <code>A</code>, and the\nfact that <code>A</code> is a <code>\\set</code>, and the definition of a set\nis an object <code>S := {s}</code> where <code>s is well defined</code> means\nthat <code>x is well defined</code>.</p><p>Furthermore, notice the <code>written:</code> and <code>called:</code> sections in\nthe definition of a function.</p><p>The text in the written section is interpreted as being\nin LaTeX math mode, and describes what symbols are written\non paper to specify that something is a function.  Here\nwe use the notation $f : A \\rightarrow B$.</p><p>The <code>called:</code> section, on the other hand, has text that\nis written using CommonMark Markdown and describes what is\nspoken when reading $f : A \\rightarrow B$, which, in this\ncase, is &quot;$f$ is a continuous function on $A$ to $B$&quot;.</p><p>Also notice that we included the optional\n<code>Metadata:overview:</code> section that has text that is written\nusing Markdown, and describes any additional information\nyou would like to add.  In this case, we call out that a\nfunction maps an input to a <em>unique</em> output.</p><p>Last, an indent based syntax is used to describe the structure\nof the definition with expressions (such as <code>A, B is \\set</code>)\nincluded in single quotes.</p><p>Now we can describe what a cartesian product of two sets\nis that we<code>\\'</code>ll need for defining a binary operation.

Here\nwe use the notation $f : A \\rightarrow B$.</p><p>The <code>called:</code> section, on the other hand, has text that\nis written using CommonMark Markdown and describes what is\nspoken when reading $f : A \\rightarrow B$, which, in this\ncase, is &quot;$f$ is a continuous function on $A$ to $B$&quot;.</p><p>Also notice that we included the optional\n<code>Metadata:overview:</code> section that has text that is written\nusing Markdown, and describes any additional information\nyou would like to add.  In this case, we call out that a\nfunction maps an input to a <em>unique</em> output.</p><p>Last, an indent based syntax is used to describe the structure\nof the definition with expressions (such as <code>A, B is \\set</code>)\nincluded in single quotes.</p><p>Now we can describe what a cartesian product of two sets\nis that we<code>'</code>ll need for defining a binary operation.

In particular, <code>as:via:</code> allows one to\nspecify how to view one mathematical object as another.

Fields\\n\\nIn the previous section, we describe what it means\\nfor a set to have an ordering of elements.\\n\\nIn this section we will describe sets with additional\\nproperties that allow binary operations to be applied\\nto elements of the set.\\n\\nThe key algebraic structure we will be defining is a\\n*field* since the real numbers turns out to be a field.\\n\\nFirst, we extend the notion of a Group defined in the\\n[A Tour of MathLingua](#/content/30_A_Tour_of_MathLingua.math)\\nsection to one where the operation of the group is\\n*commutative*.\\n::\\n\\n\\n[\\\\abelian.group]\\nDefines: G := (X, *, e)\\nmeans: 'G is \\\\group'\\nsatisfying:\\n. forAll: x, y\\n  where: 'x, y in X'\\n  then: 'x * y = y * x'\\nwritten:

'c in A'\\n. not: 'c in B'\\nwritten: \\\"A? \\\\backslash B?\\\"\\ncalled: \\\"$A?$ set minus $B?$\\\"\\n\\n\\n::\\nNow we can define what a *field* is.  Essentially, a field\\nis a set of elements with the operations of addition and\\nmultiplication that is an Abelian group under addition and\\nan Abelian group (excluding $0$) under multplication.\\n\\nThus a field abstracts the familiar algebraic details of the\\nreal numbers.  That is, the order of addition and multplication\\ndoesn`\\\\'`t matter and any non-zero real number $x$ has a\\nmultiplicative inverse, namely $1/x$.\\n::\\n\\n\\n[\\\\field]\\nDefines: F := (X, +, *, 0, 1)\\nmeans: '(X, +, 0) is \\\\abelian.group'\\nsatisfying:\\n.

Further, since it is an ordered set, it has\\nan ordering $<$.
